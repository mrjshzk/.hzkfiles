# My Personal Dotfiles

## Using currently
- Arch Linux
- Hyprland
- Hyprpaper
- Hyprlock
- Waybar
- Dunst
- (Doom Emacs) *still have to add the dotfiles to here aswell*

## Usage
1. Clone this repo to your home dir
2. Enter the dir (eg: cd 'dirname')
3. Use the 'stow' on the utilities/folders you want to use the dotfiles ('stow hyprland' -> will paste the dotfiles there to ~/.config/hyprland/*)

## Images
**TODO**

## Troubleshooting
*Make sure the dotfiles that you already have are deleted (or back them up) because 'stow' won't overwrite them*
